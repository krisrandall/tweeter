tweeter
=======


Tweeter is a WIP project that I think I might abandon even though most of it is
completed and working.



I've created this software component for use in Apps.

It shows a twitter "feed" (ie. all tweets that contain a certain hash tag) in a chat-like
window.  

Users can also "post" into this feed in the App and the post is made by an account that 
is owned by the App, on behalf of the users -- this allows both users who have a twitter
account, and those who do not, to participate in the same chat feed.

The problem is I get a *Signup Denied* "We cannot create a new account from this computer ..."
message when I try to create a twitter account.
Obviously I do not want to use my personal account for posting from within an App.

I need to be able to create a twitter account for the app to complete this component.

I'm sending this info to twitter support, hopefully they can help...
